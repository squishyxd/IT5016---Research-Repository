IT5016 - Research Repository
Student ID: 20241484
GitHub Repo Link:
This is my research repository for IT5016. It includes a mix of code I wrote myself, code I practiced with, and my thoughts on different programming ideas and design principles. I used what I’ve learned in class and added some extra notes to show how I’ve improved my understanding.
 document Breakdown:
my-code:
I have created a folder that has code I made myself during the course. I added comments and made sure each part is easy to follow.
1.	requisition_system.py: 
A basic system to manage requisitions using functions and classes.
•	Uses modules to split up the code.
•	Includes input checks so users can’t leave things blank.
•	Shows good structure with separate sections for collecting info, calculating totals, and deciding approval.
2.	IT5016_Assessment2_PartB_20241484.py:
Most recent version of the code uploaded for assessment.
•	Has built-in error checking.
•	Automatically creates approval references.
•	Tracks how many requisitions and what their status is.
inspired_code
This is a folder I made that has code examples I didn’t write, but I used to learn from and added my own notes.
pythonProject: this is a file ive made that includes all the basics and small things we have learnt throughout this portion of the course purely to keep my documents and files in a nicer state by having most of the code I haven’t written all in one file.
This part of the document has markdown things/concepts where Ive explained things I wanted to learn more about or found interesting.
•	Observer pattern notes
o	Talks about the observer pattern and how it works in programs like GUIs.
•	Modular design thoughts
o	Thoughts on why splitting code into smaller parts makes it easier to test and fix.
•	Input validation principles
o	Why it’s important to check input properly, and how it helps avoid errors.

Design Principles and Concepts I Used
•	Modular Design: I broke down the code into smaller functions and sections.
•	Encapsulation: Used classes to keep data and methods together.
•	Input Validation: Checked that users can't leave fields empty.
•	Single Responsibility: Each function or method does one job.
•	Reusable Code: Functions can be used again in other programs.
•	Readable Code: Clear names, consistent layout, and helpful comments.

 Reflections
Working on this repo helped me understand how to make better, cleaner code. I saw how my earlier work could be improved by using principles like modularity and better input checking. Writing comments and organizing things clearly made me think more about how other people (or my future self) would read and use my code.
Putting this all together showed me how much I’ve learned and also gave me a better idea of what I still want to improve. It was good to look back at my old work and make it better.

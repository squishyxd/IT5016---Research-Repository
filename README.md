# IT5016---Research-Repository
Student ID: 20241484  This repository contains a collection of original code, practice exercises, and notes exploring software design principles and programming concepts I encountered during the IT5016 course.
Working on this repo helped me understand how to make better, cleaner code. I saw how my earlier work could be improved by using principles like modularity and better input checking. Writing comments and organizing things clearly made me think more about how other people (or my future self) would read and use my code.
Putting this all together showed me how much Iâ€™ve learned and also gave me a better idea of what I still want to improve. It was good to look back at my old work and make it better.
